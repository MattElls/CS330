In my approach to design software, I always start with the thought of the requirements.  With the requirements I can see what is expected of me and where my code must go and what it needs to include.  I did not have a design process other than the step-by-step example that the course had recommended.  Which started with a shape, then goes to making a plane, then adding textures, camera movement and finally lighting.   I learned that I need to take small piece by piece attacks to coding and change a few lines at a time.  With small successes can create a big win.  
In this class I learned basically everything about creating a 3d environment, so I basically used all my new development strategies.  I had to keep in mind each step or iteration allowed me to step by step make my environment.  In the beginning I could not get my code to run as I wanted, and it now allows me to think small and then after I take that small step it will keep going to the next small step and then I will be at the top of the stairs.
Computer science has allowed me to be able to take some sourcing apart and see what is causing problems in the apps I am using.  I also have used computer science to get an internship where I am learning a ton more.  I hope to make apps as a developer so I may use the 3D graphics to make the apps more attractive.
